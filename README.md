**Dual Licensing Model:** Source Code & Hardware are licensed under AGPL v3. Documentation is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

**HydraShield** is an open-source initiative engineering the Absolute Security & Resilience Protocol (ASRP)—a unified, decentralized backbone for communication integrity and crisis resilience.

### 🌟 Mission
To build a parallel digital infrastructure that is uncensorable, robust, and mathematically secure, supporting the next generation of Web3 dApps and off-grid crisis communications.

### 🔑 Core Architectural Layers (ASRP v1.5βⱔтa)
The ASRP pipeline is built on a defensive stack to eliminate single points of failure:

| **Layer**                | **Focus**               | **Key Feature**                                           | **Primary Mitigation Target**          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Metadata Sanitization (MSL) | Payload Anonymity      | Automated EXIF/Time Stripping, Forensic Payload Fingerprinting | Forensic Recovery                      |
| Cryptographic Agility (CAL) | Encryption & Key Exchange | Hybrid PQC Mix-and-Match                                 | Quantum Computing Attack               |
| Core DLT Backbone (ASRP-Core) | Integrity & State     | DLT-Agnostic CLA, Anti-Coercion, Dynamic Identifier Falsification (DIF) | Identity Coercion & DLT Failure (PCS) |
| Transport Abstraction (TAL) | Routing & Anonymity    | Multi-Path, Tombstone Protocol (TP)                      | Traffic Correlation & Metadata Leakage |
| Security Integration (SIB)   | Endpoint Trust & Deletion | Local DNS, Modular AV, Secure Deletion Engine (SDE)      | Local MITM, Sybil Attack (PoP)         |

### 🚀 Key Differentiating Features
1. **Zero Recovery Policy**: The Secure Deletion Engine (SDE) enforces military-grade (DoD 5220.22-M equivalent) overwriting for all local data, guaranteeing absolute destruction.
2. **Network Resilience**: Sybil resistance via Proof-of-Presence (PoP) and DLT continuity via Protocol Contingency State (PCS).
3. **Absolute Anonymity**: MSL and TP combine to eliminate both payload and traffic-level metadata. DIF salts and rotates service identifiers.
4. **Quantum Hardening**: CAL future-proofs key exchange against quantum threats.
5. **Protocol Diversity**: TAL supports modular integration of networks like Tor, I2P, FreeNet, HyphaNet, and Kademlia.

# Project-HydraShield
Project HydraShield (ASRP) establishes the Absolute Security &amp; Resilience Protocol: an uncensorable, quantum-safe, and dual-licensed backbone. It employs Hybrid PQC, Dynamic Identifier Falsification (DIF), and the Secure Deletion Engine (SDE) for maximum integrity and data confidentiality in crisis-resilient communications.
